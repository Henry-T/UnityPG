		// I would have to store them in a specific folder on the phone(Which wouldn't make any sense because I could just use Resources.Load instead.
		// So the option on testing on the iOS device itself would either be from the editor like this, 
		// OR store them online on a server and set the baseURL to its http address.

		//So.. on to the loading of the bundles.
		//When loading them this way, I put each "loading command" in a list
		// That list is being checked and maintained in the Update() method.
		//Whenever a download is complete, it instantiates it as a gameobject
		// and proceeds to the next bundle to download.
		
		//To do that, I create a new LoadAssetFromBundle component
		LoadAssetFromBundle myAssetToLoad = this.gameObject.AddComponent<LoadAssetFromBundle>();
		
		//I set the asset name, the name of the bundle, and the current version of the bundle
		myAssetToLoad.QueueBundleDownload("MY_ASSET_NAME", "MY_BUNDLE_NAME.unity3d", 1);
		
		//Then, I set the URL from where it should download the bundle
		//with the value I set in the beginning of Start()
		myAssetToLoad.baseURL = baseURL;
		
		//To start the download, I add them to the "things to download list"
		// and it will start the download in the Update() method.
		assetsToLoad.Add(myAssetToLoad);
		
		//To load more than on asset this way, just create another LoadAssetFromBundle component
		// and make sure to add it to the assetsToLoad list.
