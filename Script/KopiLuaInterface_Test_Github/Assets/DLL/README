Binary distribution of KopiLua and KopiLuaInterface
===================================================

This distribution contains three libraries - KopiLua, KopiLuaDll, and
KopiLuaInterface.  The latest version is available at
http://gfootweb.webspace.virginmedia.com/KLI-bin/.

Each library has a DLL file containing the compiled code, PDB and MDB files
containing debugging information, and a VER file detailing the source code
snapshot from which the DLL was compiled.

KopiLua is built from the gfoot/kopilua repository at GitHub, and subject to
the MIT license as detailed in COPYRIGHT-KopiLua.

KopiLuaInterface is based on LuaInterface, adapted to work with KopiLua.  It's
built from the gfoot/kopiluainterface repository at GitHub, and is subject to
the MIT license as detailed in COPYRIGHT-LuaInterface.

KopiLuaDll is based on LuaDll, which is I believe an artifact of the odd way
C++ DLLs work on Windows.  It's built from the gfoot/kopiluainterface
repository at GitHub and also subject to the MIT license.

See the VER files for exact Git SHAs if you need them.
